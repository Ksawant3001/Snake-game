Game Explanation:
Canvas: The game renders on an HTML5 canvas where the snake and food are drawn.
Snake Movement: The snake moves using keyboard arrows (up, down, left, right). The setDirection() function listens for key presses and updates the snakeâ€™s direction.
Food: The snake consumes randomly placed food on the grid. When the snake eats the food, its size increases, and a new piece of food spawns.
Collision Detection: The game ends when the snake collides with the canvas border or itself.
Score: Each time the snake eats food, the score increases and is displayed.
